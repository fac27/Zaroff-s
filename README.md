This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Interacting with the page

Zaroff's is a retailer of private islands. The homepage shows you a listing of all our exclusive properties, which you can filter by region or - for those of humble finances - by price limit.

You can visit the page of each individual island to find out more about your future property. Once you have made your choice, add your desired islands to the basket and we will charge your AmEx (tax evasion will be respected).

## Testing

You can run our page's end-to-end tests in the terminal.

Make sure the development server is running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open a new terminal and run:

```bash
npm run test
```
